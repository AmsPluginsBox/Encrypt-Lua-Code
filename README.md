# Encrypt-Lua-Code
Encrypt Lua Code, and call it through an AmsLuac dll

It is a great tool for LUA code protection,
It supports lua5.1.4, not tested with other versions of LUA, but I believe it is possible to use it in other versions of LUA.

1 = Let's encrypt lua code with an executable: LuaEncrypt.exe was created in C++

2 = Let's call the encrypted lua code, to call this encrypted code we will use a DLL: AmsLuac.dll created in C++.
